                    <p>If you're going overseas, travel insurance is as important as a passport. Without it, you or your family could suffer financially if things go wrong. travel insurance should be going with you. Even if you're travelling out of province but within Canada it's worth it because your provincial health insurance plan coverage may be limited. Things like ambulance services and prescription drugs may not be covered and you could end up paying out of pocket for some of the services you need.</p>

                      <li>In some countries hospitals and clinics will not treat you if you do not have enough insurance or money to pay your bills</li>

                               As you already know, Canadian Residents are insured under their Provincial Healthcare Plans. However, it only covers a small portion of medical expenses incurred outside Canada.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your government insurance coverage will also be severely limited while travelling to another province or territory within Canada, and even the slightest injury or illness can deal a significant blow to your budget.</p>
                            <p>If you are planning on going out of your province or abroad, travel health insurance for Canadians will provide you with a simple and affordable way to protect yourself from the costs of medical emergencies that may happen during the trip.</p>

                      Travel insurance offers protection against unexpected events that can happen before or during traveling. Traveling insurance will cover both minor and major accidents. Generally, basic insurance plans cover emergency medical costs, whereas, an all-inclusive policy normally covers flight delays, trip cancellation, baggage lost, and more. Keep in mind that most of the companies will not cover the risks listed on the Government of Canada’s travel advisory site.
